               Fish and reptiles are popular pets. Reptiles are the most ancient species on Earth. They eat a variety of food based on their type. This can include being herbivores, insectivores, or carnivores. It is important to do research on reptiles as pets. Some need a special diet and maintain a certain temperature to live. Fish can be calming to watch; they are easy to care for and are an affordable option for those looking for a pet with inexpensive care. Like other animals that live in enclosures, reptiles and fish can be easy to maintain and can allow children to help with their care.
